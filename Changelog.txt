* We moved and renamed many classes to better reflect the current state of DNC.
  - "dnc", when not used in "discodnc", was renamed to "disco" to better reflect the code's origin.
  - The package "minplus" was renamed to the more general "algebra" and disco's implementations for affine an piecewise affine curves were split up.

* Split Analysis.java into three parts:
  - The Analysis interface that also provides static methods for simple execution of analyses.
  - The abstract class AbstractAnalysis holds member variables for the network, the configurations and the results.
  All analyses in de.uni_kl.cs.disco.nc.analyses extend AbstractAnalysis and implement Analysis.
 * Split ArrivalBound.java into three parts:
  - The minimal ArrivalBound interface.
  - The abstract class ArrivalBoundDispatch that applies the configured arrival boundings.
  - The abstract class AbstractArrivalBound holds member variables for the network and the configurations.
  All arrival bounds in de.uni_kl.cs.disco.nc.arrivalbounds extend AbstractArrivalBound, all but the sink-tree version also implement ArrivalBound.

  - Renamed to CurvePwAffineUtils.
  - Made it an abstract class.
* LinearSegmentFactoryDispatch is not dispatching but a factory itself; renamed to LinearSegmentFactory.
* Merge of MinPlusInputChecks and MinPlusDispatch to MinPlus.

  The DiscoDNC is now built on a factory pattern with four implementations -- the lower body and the four legs of our new Centaur release. 
  - Num.java is now an interface to be implemented by the actual number representations in unikl.disco.numbers.implementations.
  - NumFactory.java provides methods to create a number, takes care of the representation given in the CalculatorConfig.
  - NumUtils.java provides methods to work with objects implementing the Num interface.

 - Visibility was restricted, reading the value is enabled by isDelayedInfiniteBurst().
* LinearSegment.java: Constructors that accept primitive double arguments were added.
* FunctionalTests: 
 - Streamlined test config generation.

v2.2.5 "Hydra" (2015-Sep-29)
----------------------------
* Fixed deconvolution for delivering too optimistic results for some combinations of multi token buckets and multi rate latencies. Remember: The DiscoDNC is only tested for token-bucket arrivals and rate-latency service. Any other offering will is best effort. Please report encountered bugs.  
* Curves: Creating a curve with specified segments count: All but the first segment will be leftopen.
* Changed constructor visibility in NumDouble from protected to public.

* Minor clean ups and efficiency improvements.

v2.2.0 "Hydra" (2015-May-15)
----------------------------
* This is the first version checked with Coverity Scan (incl. FindBugs). We fixed all the uncovered performance issues and now pass the checks with 0 defects.

 - Num is now an abstract class that coordinates creation of and calls to the right number representation.
* CalculatorConfig: New flag NUM_CLASS to set the internal number representation:
 - Replaces previous need to copy the respective classes content of Num.
 - Be careful: Switching the number representation while the calculator is running will result in casting exceptions!
* Package structure: All number related classes have been moved to unikl.disco.numbers.
* Num_Fraction:
 - Adapted structure to Num_double, i.e., it now holds a Fraction object instead of extending Fraction.

 - Update naming scheme to match latest publications (prev. nomenclature).
 - Documentation files contain a version number and possibly a changelog and acknowledgements.
 - Started adapting PMOO's T^{l.o.} computation to be closer to the code (only in FeedForward as of now).
 - Minor fixes in the single server documentation.
* Apache Commons Math: Updated bundled version to 3.4.

v2.0.2 "Hydra" (2014-Nov-19)
----------------------------
* New feature: Network configurations can now be saved in a format that allows for reuse: 
 - Curves, LinearSegment, Num: Added constructors parsing a string representation of curves.
 - Curves, Num_double: Reduced code duplication.
 - Path: Changed visibility of constructor Path( Server single_hop ) to public (see comment there for reasoning).
 - Network: Improved creation of paths from lists of servers or links, saving functionality.
* Arrival bounds: Removed duplicate local variables.
* Functional tests:
 - Extended functional tests to check for unexpected exceptions.
 - Moved remaining static configuration options to FunctionalTests to reduce code duplication.
* Curve: Improved decomposition of curves into rate latencies or token buckets for PMOO.
* ServiceCurve: Removed effectively dead sanity check.
* Minor improvements of the documentation and naming of internal variables. 

v2.0.1 "Hydra" (2014-Oct-16)
----------------------------
* Bugfix in ArrivalBound. Removed bad sanity checks always resulting in false.
* Server, Flow: Removed internal ID from string output.
* Flow: Removed unnecessary throws declaration from getServersOnPath(), string representation does not convert alias to lower case anymore.
* Path: Cleaned up usage of LinkedList instead of List, removed “throws Exception” from constructors.
* Network: Reworked toString to produce pseudo-code close to the creation of a network, renamed parameter in getFlowsPerServer and getFlowsPerSubPath to use application-agnostic vocabulary.
* LinearSegment, curves: Added toString() method to LinearSegment and call it from when converting curves to strings rather than using internal conversion code, reduced code duplication across the toString() methods.
* Curve: Added a patch to the shiftRight-method to handle rounding errors with the double-based number representation that can lead to violating the f(0)=0 requirement.
* Configuration: Consistent naming (defaultArrivalBoundCalculations -> defaultArrivalBoundMethods), Changed default arrival boding method from PBOO_PER_HOP to PBOO_CONCATENATION.
* Demos: Made sure all intermediate results will be printed with information about which server they belong to (TFA, SFA), renamed instances of the analyses to match functional tests (sf -> sfa and tf -> tfa).
* Functional tests: Completed combinations of code paths that can be tested and reduced code duplication while doing so. The number of functional tests increased from 1800 to 8200.
* Apache Commons Math: Updated bundled version to 3.3.
* Minor improvements of the documentation and naming of internal variables.
