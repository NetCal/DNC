v2.4.0beta3 "Chimera" (2017-Sep-XY)
-----------------------------------
* Split Analysis.java into three parts:
  - The minimal Analysis interface.
  - The abstract class AnalysisDispatch provides convenient methods to create and run an analysis.
  - The abstract class AbstractAnalysis holds member variables for the network, the configurations and the results.
  All analyses in de.uni_kl.cs.disco.nc.analyses extend AbstractAnalysis and implement Analysis.
 * Split ArrivalBound.java into three parts:
  - The minimal ArrivalBound interface.
  - The abstract class ArrivalBoundDispatch that applies the configured arrival boundings.
  - The abstract class AbstractArrivalBound holds member variables for the network and the configurations.
  All arrival bounds in de.uni_kl.cs.disco.nc.arrivalbounds extend AbstractArrivalBound, all but the sink-tree version also implement ArrivalBound.
* Streamlined the NumFactoryDispatch code. 
* Disco (min,+)-algebraic operations:
  - Moved to new package de.uni_kl.cs.disco.minplus.dnc
  - All convolutions are called via a dispatcher, MinPlusDispatch.java. 
  - Extension to manipulate MPA RTC curves with their native operations is not yet tested.

v2.4.0beta2 "Chimera" (2017-Aug-17)
-----------------------------------

* Reworked CalculatorConfig.java to singleton pattern (improves tests run time considerably).

v2.4.0beta1 "Chimera" (2017-Aug-02)
-----------------------------------
* An alternative curve backend for the DiscoDNC analyses:
  This release wraps the MPA RTC Toolbox's curve implementation to be used with the DiscoDNC. It continues the work presented at ECRTS 2017:
     Philipp Schon and Steffen Bondorf, Towards Unified Tool Support for Real-time Calculus & Deterministic Network Calculus.
  The required MPA RTC library is available at www.mpa.ethz.ch/Rtctoolbox/
* Package naming now complies with the Java rules. Our domain disco.cs.uni-kl.de translates to the package prefix de.uni_kl.cs.disco. 

v2.3.5 "Centaur" (2017-Jun-25)
------------------------------
* Network.java:

  - SaveAs won't fail if the directory already exists.
* AnalysisResult.java:
  - Reduced visibility of delay and backlog bound variables from public to protected.
  - Get methods are public, set are protected (and overwritten by extending classes) so they are only accessed by the respective analysis.

* Convolution.java, convolve_SC_SC_RLs: Fix for the case that two rate-latency service curves should be convolved, yet, two null objects are given.
* FunctionalTests, renamed to DncTests:
  - New naming scheme including more information. 
  - Separated networks from the tests and expected results.
  - Reduced complexity of individual tests classes by moving code to the super class DncTest.
  - Replaced System.out.println( e.toString() ) with e.printStackTrace().
  - Converted the output test to a JUnit test automatically compiling the generated class.
  - Performance improvements.

v2.3.2 "Centaur" (2017-Mar-13)
------------------------------
* Advanced the structure of package unikl.disco.nc (sub-)packages for analyses, arrivalBounds and operations.
* OutputBound.java: New class in unikl.disco.nc.operations providing the DNC output bound computation (reduces code duplication).
* LeftOverService: A generic compute(...) method dispatches according to the analysis configuratoin's multiplexing flag. Used in SFA and PbooAB.
* Fix: PBOO Arrival Bounding with per-hop left-over service now uses each server's max SC instead of an overly pessimistic entire common path's one.
* Fix: PMOO Arrival Bounding's shortcut for single-hop subpaths was actually dead code before.
* Added findbugs library.

v2.3.1 "Centaur" (2017-Feb-28)

* Package minplus: Improved stability by handling distorted input (null or empty sets). 
* Deconvolution: Renamed private method deconvolveGeneric to deconvolve_mTB_mRL to better reflect its capabilities. 

v2.3.0 "Centaur" (2017-Jan-11)
------------------------------
* Rework of the number abstraction layer in unikl.disco.numbers:
  The DiscoDNC is now built on a factory pattern with four implementations -- the lower body and the four legs of our new Centaur release. 
  - Num.java is now an interface to be implemented by the actual number representations in unikl.disco.numbers.implementations.
  - NumFactory.java provides methods to create a number, takes care of the representation given in the CalculatorConfig.
  - NumUtils.java provides methods to work with objects implementing the Num interface.
  - unikl.disco.numbers.implementations provides four implementations:
    - Real numbers with single precision or double precision.
    	- Both provide a flag to account for potential rounding errors when comparing numbers (comparison_epsilon).
    - Rational numbers based on Integer or BigInteger (requires Apache Commons Math 3 and special values in unikl.disco.numbers.values). 
* Convolution.java: Improvements for convolution involving \delta_T.
* Functional Tests: Further streamlined test configuration generation.
* Curve.java: isBurstDelay() was removed, functionality is provided by isDelayedInfiniteBurst() since version 2.2.7.
* Network.java: Fixed getting a server by its ID (had an offset of +1 before).
* Removed methods that were deprecated in v2.2.
* Path.java: Renamed createNullPath to createEmptyPath.
* Updated the output tests (also serves as the demo for saving a network and reusing it).
* Better distinction between number zero and null objects: 
  - Renamed *null{Segment,Curve,ArrivalCurve,ServiceCurve,MaxServiceCurve}* to *zero{Segment,Curve,ArrivalCurve,ServiceCurve,MaxServiceCurve} *
  - Convolution of an arrival curve with a null object now returns the arrival curve instead of a zeroArrival curve.
* CalculatorConfig.java: NUM_CLASS is now only accessible via get and set.

v2.2.8 "Heavy Ion" (2016-Dec-06)
--------------------------------
* Fixed bugs concerning the delay and backlog bounding with \delta_T, T>0, service curves (delayed infinite burst).
* Improved JavaDocs for use_gamma and use_extra_gamma
Thanks to Mathias Kreider from the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research for reporting these bugs. This release was code named "Heavy Ion".

v2.2.7 "Hydra" (2016-Nov-17)
----------------------------
* Fixed a bug when convolving \delta_T with T>0 (delayed infinite burst).
* Curve.java:
 - is_zero_delay_infinite_burst was replaced by the more general is_delayed_infinite_burst.
 - Visibility was restricted, reading the value is enabled by isDelayedInfiniteBurst().
* LinearSegment.java: Constructors that accept primitive double arguments were added.
* FunctionalTests: 
 - Streamlined test config generation.
 - assertEquals based on double values now considers the internal number representation's rounding error safety margin epsilon. 

v2.2.6 "Hydra" (2016-Mar-31)
----------------------------
* Added the arrival bound burstiness reduction of the MMB & DFT 2016 paper
   "Improving Cross-Traffic Bounds in Feed-Forward Networks - There is a Job for Everyone".
  It can be switched on in the analysis configuration by setting the flag ab_consider_tfa_nodeBacklog to true.
* Apache Commons Math version updated to 3.6.1.

v2.2.5 "Hydra" (2015-Sep-29)
----------------------------
* Fixed deconvolution for delivering too optimistic results for some combinations of multi token buckets and multi rate latencies. Remember: The DiscoDNC is only tested for token-bucket arrivals and rate-latency service. Any other offering will is best effort. Please report encountered bugs.  
* Curves: Creating a curve with specified segments count: All but the first segment will be leftopen.
* Changed constructor visibility in NumDouble from protected to public.

* Added functions de-/convolving sets of curves.
* Improved saving of large networks (see unikl.disco.tests.output.TestNetwork):
 - Functions creating serves, links and flows have been split up to be smaller than 65536 bytes.
 - Remaining problem for large networks: Constant pool (i.e., total amount of servers, links, flows) exceeding 65536 entries results in a failure.
* Minor clean ups and efficiency improvements.

v2.2.0 "Hydra" (2015-May-15)
----------------------------
* This is the first version checked with Coverity Scan (incl. FindBugs). We fixed all the uncovered performance issues and now pass the checks with 0 defects.
* Reworked the Num classes in order to allow switching the number representation with a flag in CalculatorConfig (see below): 
 - Num is now an abstract class that coordinates creation of and calls to the right number representation.
* CalculatorConfig: New flag NUM_CLASS to set the internal number representation:
 - Replaces previous need to copy the respective classes content of Num.
 - Be careful: Switching the number representation while the calculator is running will result in casting exceptions!
* Package structure: All number related classes have been moved to unikl.disco.numbers.
* Num_Fraction:
 - Adapted structure to Num_double, i.e., it now holds a Fraction object instead of extending Fraction. 
 - Check for special value representation (infinity, NaN) is now done once at creation time instead of on demand before every operation.
 - Rewrote some operators to use Fraction's functionality more.
* Functional tests now run with both number classes each.
* unikl.disco.network.*: Reworked the to*String methods to remove dependency on the static calculator configuration.

    - Update of bundled version to 3.5.
 	- It is not a hard dependency anymore.
 - hamcrest-core 1.3 was updated to java-hamcrest 2.0.0.0.
